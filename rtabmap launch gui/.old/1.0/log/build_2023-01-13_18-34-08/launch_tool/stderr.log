CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQtWidgets.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "QtWidgets", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "QtWidgets" with
  any of the following names:

    QtWidgetsConfig.cmake
    qtwidgets-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "QtWidgets" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "QtWidgets_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "QtWidgets" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
